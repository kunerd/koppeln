# Koppeln
Koppeln is a minimalistic standalone dynamic DNS server.

**:warning: WARNING: not ready for production**

## Usage
At the moment Koppeln is under heavy development and therefore not yet ready for production use.
To build and run Koppeln from source you can either use `cargo` or `docker`. See instructions below. In any case the first step is to get the newest version from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/kunerd/koppeln.git
```

Keep in mind that the current version is only tested to work under the Linux operating system. Building and running it under other OS may or may not work. Anyway, feel free to create an issue, if you encounter any problem during build or while running the server. 

## Development
We use `cargo make` to run advanced build steps like end-to-end testing, packaging .deb files and building in docker containers. Nevertheless, all normal cargo commands should work fine, too.

### Run E2E tests
The E2E test setup is in an early stage and might not work as expected in some circumstances. Please create a ticket if you have any trouble to get the tests to run properly.

Before you can run the E2E tests you need to install the following additional software:
* docker
* docker build plugin
* lxc
* cargo make

After setting up the additional tools you just need to run:
```
$ cargo make e2e-tests
```

### Update a DNS entry
All configuration files under `./config` contain an entry to setup the DNS address `test.dyn.example.com`.

```
[addresses]
"test.dyn.example.com" = { token = "super_secure" }
```

At startup time there will be no IP address for this DNS entry. The IP address can be set/updated with the folling RESTful API call:

```
$ curl -X PUT \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: super_secure" \
	--data '{"ip":"12.13.14.15", "hostname":"test.dyn.example.com"}' \
	http://localhost:8088/hostname
```
